## About myself


After obtaining my master's degree in education I worked at the Belarusian National Technical University as a lecturer for 2 years. Closely working with students of Software Engineering, my interest in development grew up. Consequently, I started learning UI/UX Design and took two specializations at Google and California Institute of Arts. Having developed several app interfaces, I recognizes that it wasn't enough for me and I want to develop as a frontend developer. 

I am keen on learning and challenging myself. My strong communicative skills help me in resolving obstacles. Besides, I can organize my work efficiently and effectively. 

I reckon that my strong desire and skills can assist me in becoming great frontend developer.
